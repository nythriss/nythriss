### 🖤 About Me

- 👋 Hi, I’m **@nythriss**
- 🧠 Passionate about **Web Design**, **Game Development**, **AI**, and **drones** (yes, flying things that obey my will)  
- 🔮 I dabble in **modding** and love both **Godot** and **Unity**  
- 💻 Favorite languages: `C#`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, and good old `C`  
- 🕷️ I prefer small, tightly-knit teams — but I’m open to **open-source** if the energy fits  
- 🔥 I learn by building, not buying — currently crafting a full game in **Godot** by myself
